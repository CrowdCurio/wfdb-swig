The [WFDB library](http://physionet.nlm.nih.gov/physiotools/wfdb.shtml) is a collection of specialized functions that provide uniform access to digitized signals and annotations in a wide variety of formats, including those in [PhysioBank](http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/). The WFDB library is written in C and includes bindings for C++ and wrappers for Fortran.

The wfdb-swig package provides wrappers that permit programs written in several other programming languages to use the WFDB library. The wrappers are generated automatically using the [Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator (SWIG)](http://www.swig.org/).

Supported target languages include Python and  Java.

Support for Perl, Octave and C# have been dropped due to lack of interest, but the relavent files are still available in the 'deprecated' subdirectory.

It is also possible, with very little additional effort, to generate wrappers for other languages supported by SWIG, such as PHP or Ruby.

The wrappers were originally developed at [PhysioNet](http://www.physionet.org).
