General instructions for installing WFDB wrappers

If you have not already done so, install the WFDB library (see
http://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml) and the SWIG package
(see http://www.swig.org) for your platform.

Note: under Mac OS X, compile SWIG from sources (from the SWIG web site,
above) to get a scriptable SWIG;  the precompiled Mac OS X SWIG package
available from the SWIG web site is a GUI-only version that cannot be run from
the automated installation scripts included here.

Although executable programs written in some of the target languages are
portable across platforms, the WFDB wrappers themselves are not!  Each
wrapper relies on a native "glue" layer, on the interpreter or compiler for
the target language, and on the WFDB library itself.  Therefore, you must
always install versions of the WFDB wrappers and the WFDB library that have
been built for your CPU type, operating system, and interpreter or compiler.
Since it is not practical to distribute precompiled wrappers for all possible
combinations of platforms and target interpreters/compilers, in practice this
means that you must compile the wrappers yourself, following the instructions
here.

To create WFDB wrappers for all tested languages, type:
	make WFDB_HOME=/opt/wfdb

To install WFDB wrappers for all tested languages, type:
	make install
On most platforms you will need root (administrator) privileges to complete
this step.

To check the installation, type:
	make check
This test verifies that the wrappers have been successfully installed,
and provides a simple test of basic functions.

If you prefer, you can build wrappers for each language separately.  Please see
the documentation in each subdirectory for specific instructions:

	wfdb-csharp/INSTALL  (for C# and other .NET languages)
	wfdb-java/INSTALL
	wfdb-python/INSTALL

See README in this directory for additional information about the WFDB
wrappers.
