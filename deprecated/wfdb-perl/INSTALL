Installation notes for WFDB Perl wrappers

If you have not already done so, install the WFDB library, SWIG, and Perl 5:

	WFDB (http://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml)
	SWIG (http://www.swig.org/)
	Perl 5 (http://www.perl.org/)

See 'INSTALL' in the parent of this directory for further information.

To make the wfdb-perl module, type:
	make
If 'Makefile' and 'wfdb_perl_wrap.c' do not exist already, this command
will create them using 'perl Makefile.PL' and SWIG before building the module.

To install the wfdb-perl module, type:
	make install
This command installs the module (wfdb.so) and its perl interface (wfdb.pm).
On most platforms you will need root (administrator) privileges to complete
this step.

To test the installation, type:
	make check
This command runs a Perl version of the trivial example program from chapter
1 of the WFDB Programmer's Guide:
	perl ../examples/psamples.pl
and compares its output with the expected output (in ../examples/psamples.out).
The output of 'make check' is either 'Passed' or 'Failed'.  If you run
psamples.pl directly, its output should be:
        995     1011
        995     1011
        995     1011
        995     1011
        995     1011
        995     1011
        995     1011
        995     1011
        1000    1008
        997     1008

The ../examples directory also contains translations into Perl 5 of the other
examples from the WFDB Programmer's Guide.
